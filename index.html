      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Hi, I’m Zurab. I’m currently a <strong>Big Data Engineer at the Bank of Georgia</strong>, 
        working in the Customer Tribe’s Offers Hub. Together with developers and business teams, 
        we enable internal teams to create and deliver personalized offers, as well as external 
        partner products, directly to customers. My day-to-day involves Spark, Kafka, Airflow, 
        Yarn, and Hadoop, ensuring that campaigns run reliably, efficiently, and on time. 
        I design, monitor, and maintain both daily and continuous data pipelines to guarantee 
        the quality and readiness of our information.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My journey began with a love for science and problem-solving. As a school student, 
        I competed in international Math and Physics Olympiads, traveling the world as a 
        member of the Georgian National Team. Winning a <strong>Silver Medal at the International Physics 
        Olympiad 2018 in Lisbon</strong>—a first for my country—earned me a full scholarship to 
        <strong>New York University</strong>, where I studied Mathematics and Machine Learning.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Driven by curiosity in quantum science, I continued my academic path at the 
        <strong>Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</strong>, one of the world’s top five 
        physics research centers, completing an MSc in Quantum Physics and exploring the 
        foundations of quantum science in depth. Today, I blend this scientific rigor with my 
        engineering expertise to build scalable, high-performance data systems that make an impact. 
        I also have wide interests in data/AI technologies, quantum science, and financial mathematics, 
        and I plan to share various projects publicly along the way.
